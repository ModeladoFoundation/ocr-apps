This is an AFL version of the sequential-csr version of Graph500 ref impl.

It's just a wrapper around the real graph code, providing enough AFL-ism
that memalyzer can run with it.

As of 5/6/2012, still very much WIP.  In fact, it dumps core at the end
after some assert fail in AFL somewhere.  This will be fixed later.
