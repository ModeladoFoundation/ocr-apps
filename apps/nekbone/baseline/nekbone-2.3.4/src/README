  Nek_comm-1.0

This is the communication testing kernel for the MPI
all reduce and point to point communication used within
the nekbone mini-app and standard NEK5000.  This kernel
runs a battery of platform timers using MPI standard.

To Run:

  NOTE - Unlike the other nek codes, a data.rea file
	is not needed, since there is no geometry
	being set up.

  After untarring nek_comm-1.0.tgz, change working
  directory to the nek_comm/test/ directory:
     cd  ~/nek_comm/test/

  Edit the makenek script to specify the compiler and
  appropriate compiler flags.

  Compile and link the code using the makenek script:
      ./makenek n
  where n is the chosen name of test run.

  A successful compilation will result with:

  #############################################################
  #                  Compilation successful!                  #
  #############################################################

  And a nekcomm executable.

  Run the code in parallel using the provided nekpmpi script
  by specifying the test name (for logfile naming purposes)
  and the number of processors.  For example, to run a test
  called 'n' on 4 processes:
     ./nekpmpi n 4

  This will produce a logfile, n.log.4.


Interpreting results:

  The logfile will have a header describing the parameters the
  test was ran with and the output of the timing tests.

  All reduce tests are output with the a 'gop' tag:
		np  nwds time1 time2
  where,
	 np - number of processors
	 nwds - number of words
	 tmsg - time per message
 	 tpwd - time per word


  Point to point tests are output with the 'pg' tag:
		nodeb np nloop nwds tmsg tpwd
  where,
	 nodeb - the second processor node 0 is
	 testing with
	 np - number of processors
	 nloop - number of tests ran with these nodes
	 nwds - number of words per message
	 tmsg - time per message
	 tpwd - time per word
