OCR rewriting of the NPB CG benchmark.

To build:
    OCR_TYPE=x86-pthread-x86 make all install
Tested for OCR_TYPE x86-pthread-x86, x86-pthread-tg and tg

To run:
    OCR_TYPE=x86-pthread-x86 make run to run the toy (T) problem size
    You can also run from install/OCR_TYPE/ (for non pure tg) as:
OCR_INSTALL should be set to the proper installation of OCR
./cg_ocr -ocr:cfg ${OCR_INSTALL}/config/default.cfg for the default problem size
./cg_ocr -ocr:cfg ${OCR_INSTALL}/config/default.cfg -h to get available options


Instead of -ocr:cfg, you can also set the OCR_CONFIG environment variable.
