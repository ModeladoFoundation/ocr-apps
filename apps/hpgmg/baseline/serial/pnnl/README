This is an intermediate serial version of HPGMG,
used to validate data structure refactor.

gcc hpgmg.c

Problem size is set to:
    - 2x2x2 blocks (at level 0)
    - 16x16x16 cells (at level 0)
    - 6 levels
    - 10 cycles
    - 4 smooth cycles
 * modify these in hpgmg_defs.h

The expected output for the problem size above is:

Normal of residual 3.1955549317785881e-12
norm_of_f: 0.21301702240106124
norm_of_dinv: 1
1.5001406440477351e-11
