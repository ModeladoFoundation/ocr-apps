- more efficient ghost zone exchange (box intersection algebra) when communicating edges and corners
- #define'd box/block list, box/block element iterators that allow easy replacement of omp with ???
- communication-avoiding smoothers (wavefront, simdized)
- high-order (4th order) operators
  - 27pt constant coefficient + Mehrstellen
  - 13pt constant coefficient
  - 61pt(?) variable coefficient
