HPGMG R-Stream OCR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This application is best run on the xstack foobar cluster. This version of
HPGMG has been optimized by the R-Stream compiler. R-Stream is a source-to-
source compiler that accepts a sequential C program as input and produces code
that has been parallelized and optimized for parallel processors and accelerators.

CONFIGURE ENVIRONMENT
---------------------

Before running the build.sh command, please set the environment variable
OCR_HOME to designate the root directory of OCR.

It is highly recommended to increase the deque size in OCR to at least 10000.
This can be accomplished by setting the CFLAGS_USER environment variable with
the appropriate value and rebuilding OCR:

cd $OCR_HOME/build
export CFLAGS_USER="-DINIT_DEQUE_CAPACITY=10000"
OCR_TYPE=x86 make install

-----
BUILD
-----
Run the following command to build HPGMG:

./build.sh

This will build both the "modern" and "exascale" proxy applications.

The modern code uses V-cycles, Gauss-Seidel Red-black smoother, and BiCGStab
bottom solver. The exascale code uses F-cycles, Chebyshev smoother, and BiCGStab
bottom solver.

---
RUN
---
To run these binaries on a range of problem sizes, execute the run.sh script:

run.sh [exascale|modern] [OCR config file] [log2 box dimension] [target # of boxes]

[exascale|modern]: modern is V cycles, gsrb smoother.
                   exascale is F cycles, chebyshev smoother.

[OCR config file]: An OCR config file
                   (found in $OCR_HOME/install/x86/config/ for instance)

[log2 box dimension]: log2 of the dimension n for each n^3 sized box in the
                      multigrid run. Typical values are 4, 5, and 6.

[target # of boxes]: number of n^3 boxes in the multigrid run. Number is used
                     in conjunction with [log2 box dimension] to "influence"
                     total problem size. "Influence" because hpgmg always
                     creates a cube of boxes and will tweak the number of boxes
                     to achieve this. The following three combinations of
                     [log2 box dimension] and [target # of boxes] lead to
                     the exact same problem size:
                     4 4096 (16^3 grid of 16^3 boxes)
                     5  512 ( 8^3 grid of 32^3 boxes)
                     6   64 ( 4^3 grid of 64^3 boxes)

----
TEST
----
The included script test.sh tests the modern and exascale proxies at known good
problem sizes. To test, run the following command:

./test.sh

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
 OCR currently emits a number of warnings regarding DB acquisition when
  running the rocr code:

  API(WARN) [PD:0x0 W:0x1cd84c60 EDT:0x0] Acquiring DB (GUID: 0x7f1368739b40)
  from outside an EDT ... auto-release will fail

  This does not affect program correctness, nor does it adversely affect memory
  consumption. The R-Stream OCR runtime manages allocation and deallocation of
  OCR DB and does not use any auto-release features of the OCR runtime.

* Some problem sizes cause the OCR allocator to run out of memory leading to
  a segfault. The following sizes should work with both modern and exascale
  codes:

  log2box=4  target_boxes <= 512
  log2box=5  target_boxes <= 256
  log2box=6  target_boxes <= 64
