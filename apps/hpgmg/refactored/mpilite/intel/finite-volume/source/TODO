- generalized/optimized boundary condition enforcement... block copies like ghost zones?
- cubical problem size -> rectahedral problem size ... init problem, restriction rules, etc...
- cycleTime:  uint64_t nanoseconds to double seconds.  cycles.* convert to double
- communication-avoiding smoothers (wavefront, simdized)
- more efficient ghost zone exchange (box intersection algebra) when communicating edges and corners
- high-order (4th order) operators
  - 13pt constant coefficient
  - 27pt constant coefficient + Mehrstellen
  - 125pt(?) variable coefficient
