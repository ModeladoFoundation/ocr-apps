# Introduction
###
This directory contains the kernels/applications worked on as part of the TG project

The structure of this directory is as follows:

  apps/
  |
  #Older directory structure: E.g., cholesky, fibonacci, fft, smithwaterman, etc.
  |
  |---- <old_app1>/                     # Different implementations of app1
  |     |------ ocr/                    # OCR implementation (symlink when mature)
  |     \------ <omp|mpi|others...>/    # Any other implementation we want to compare against
  |
  #Newer (recommended) directory structure: E.g., CoMD, miniAMR, RSBench, tempest, hpgmg, SNAP, XSBench, Stencil1D, etc.
  |
  |---- <new_app1>/                     # Different implementations of app1
  |     |---- refactored/               # Refactored implementations (runs on OCR)
  |     |     \---- <ocr|icnc|hta|...>  # High-level expression of the program (CnC, HTA, ...)
  |     |           \---- <owner>       # Institution responsible for the program (SDSC, LLNL, ...)
  |     |---- baseline/                 # Original or legacy implementations
  |     |     \---- <omp|serial|mpi>    # High-level expression of the program (C, MPI, etc.); use 'mpi-serial', for example, if implementation supports multiple modes
  |     |           \---- <owner>       # Institution responsible for the program; use 'doe-original' for original DoE apps.
  |     \---- datasets/                 # Data for the application (common to various implementations)
  |
  |---- ...                             # Other applications
  |
  |---- libs/                           # Support libraries (common across applications)
  |     |---- src/                      # Source of these libraries
  |     |     |--- <lib1>/
  |     |     \--- ...
  |     |
  |     |---- tg/                       # Installation path for TG compiled libs
  |     |     |-- include/
  |     |     \-- lib/
  |     |
  |     \---- x86/                      # Installation path for x86 compiled libs
  |           |--- include/
  |           \--- lib/
  |
  \---- makefiles/                      # OCR Makefiles

# Best practices
###
    - Develop your OCR application directly in this hierarchy
    - Once your OCR application is mature (and publically releasable), use git mv to move it
      to ocr/ocr-apps/<app-name> and modify the default paths at the top of the Makefiles. Establish
      a symlink between apps/<app-name>/ocr and ocr/ocr-apps/<app-name>

    - All libraries should have a Makefile that uses an ARCH environment variable to build
      the library either for x86 or TG. See libs/src/libc/ for an example
