# Introduction
###
This directory contains the applications worked on as part of the TG project

The structure of this directory is as follows:
  apps/
  |---- <app1>/                      # Different implementations of app1
  |     |------ ocr/                 # OCR implementation (symlink when mature)
  |     \------ <omp|mpi|others...>/ # Any other implementation we want to compare against
  |
  |---- ...                          # Other applications
  |
  |---- libs/                        # Support libraries (common across applications)
  |     |---- src/                   # Source of these libraries
  |     |     |--- <lib1>/
  |     |     \--- ...
  |     |
  |     |---- tg/                    # Installation path for TG compiled libs
  |     |     |-- include/
  |     |     \-- lib/
  |     |
  |     \---- x86/                   # Installation path for x86 compiled libs
  |           |--- include/
  |           \--- lib/
  |
  |---- makefiles/                   # OCR Makefiles
  |
  \---- ocr-wrapper.sh               # Script to invoke OCR applications

# Compatible applications
###
This is the list of apps that have been "ported" to this new directory and build structure:
    - cholesky
    - fibonacci
    - fft
    - smithwaterman

###
# Best practices
###
    - Develop your OCR application directly in this hierarchy
    - Once your OCR application is mature (and publically releasable), use git mv to move it
      to ocr/ocr-apps/<app-name> and modify the default paths at the top of the Makefiles. Establish
      a symlink between apps/<app-name>/ocr and ocr/ocr-apps/<app-name>

    - All libraries should have a Makefile that uses an ARCH environment variable to build
      the library either for x86 or TG. See libs/src/libc/ for an example
