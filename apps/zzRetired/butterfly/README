This is the Cooley-Tukey algorithm in Serial and in Parallel
!------ Important ------!
It requires that you have a power of two number of points

You can compile with
make clean
make

and run with
./serial [Input/file]
./parallel [Input/file] [number of threads (power of two)]

or you can use the function
FourierTransform(point *X, int N, int inverse)
where
	X is the array of points
	N is the number of points / length of X
	inverse: -1 for the inverse Fourier Transform, otherwise Fourier Transform
directly by including FFT.h

example use:
#inlcude "FFT.h"

int main()
{
	point *my_points = buildDataPoints("Input/default.txt");
	point *fftPoints = FourierTransform(my_points, getNumPoints(), 1);

	return 0;
}
