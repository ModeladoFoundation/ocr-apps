This benchmark is build using the SNAP package version 0.4 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/snap-graph/).
Given an R-MAT graph it computes  100 runs of  breadth first search over randomly choosen nodes.
The parallelization mechanism for bfs is openmp.

 The final timings for graph generation and bfs are collected in benchmark_bfs_timings.txt.

To build the benchmark:
 1. Build snap package with openmp support (./configure --enable-openmp) within the snap directory
 2. compile rmat-bfs.c (see compile.sh)

Running the program:
rmat-bfs takes as input the graph generated by ../boost_parallel_graph_kernel/rmat-gen.
Hence its arguments are prefix and num_process. If the graph is generated using 2 mpi-process with prefix pre then we issue the command as
follows (see test.sh)
./rmat-bfs ../boost_parallel_graph_kernel/pre 2


To run the benchmark: type ./test.sh to produce bfs_stat.txt

Relevant files to fine tune the benchmark

 2. rmat-gen.c
 3. rmat-bfs.c
