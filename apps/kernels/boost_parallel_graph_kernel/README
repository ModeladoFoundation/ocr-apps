This directory has two programs:
1) Parallel R-MAT generator (rmat_gen)
2) BFS benchmark (bfs_benchmark)

Building:
Requires MPI and boost graph library. 
Modify the compile.sh to point to your boost and mpi headers and libraries.



Running and Outputs:
./rmat_gen takes two commands p and prefix to generate a graph of size 2^p. See rmat_gen.sh
The output is list of edges and ared  stored in prefix0.gr,prefix1.gr files.


./bfs_benchmark takes prefix argument. It reads edges from prefix0.gr, prefix1.gr*.
It computes 50 bfs runs using random locations.




*Caveat: As of now please use the same number of mpi-process for both generation and bfs_benchark.


The output is a tuple with number_of_edges, total duration, and avg. teps.
