xeonNumaSize is a test program for evaluating allocation
ideas and memory use in a KNL (Knights Landing) processor.

To build this application:

cd to the ocr/ocr/build/x86-phi directory and do:
    CC=icc OCR_TYPE=x86-phi make install

Then ce to the apps/apps/examples/xeonNumaSize directory
and do:
    make -f Makefile.x86-phi-mpi run


Put the following in a shell script named "rapp" (run
application).  Make sure that "$HOME/src/apps" and
"$HOME/src/ocr" are the tops of the apps and ocr trees
respectively.  Adjust the script as needed...

  #!/bin/bash
  APP=xeonNumaSize
  TGT=$HOME/src/apps/apps/examples/$APP/install/x86-phi-mpi
  export OCR_INSTALL=$HOME/src/ocr/ocr/install
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/src/ocr/ocr/install/lib:$HOME/src/apps/apps/libs/install/x86/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
  export OCR_CONFIG=$TGT/generated.cfg

  cd $TGT
  echo ./$APP $*
  ./$APP $*

Run the program with no args, or with "-h" and you'll get help.

The tst.sh script is an example of running the program to test DRAM/DDR performance
and MCDRAM performance.

The tst2.sh script was used to evaluate cache line performance.
The test program locks down as many constraints as it can.

The tst3.sh script was used to evaluate the quick-allocator change
that implemented the cache line offset.
