This is a simple application to test the priority scheduler.

The following options are set in the makefile to enable the
priority scheduler heuristic and corresponding scheduler objects,
and force the application to run with a single worker thread:

    CONFIG_NUM_THREADS := 1

Build and run the application using the following command:

    make -f Makefile.x86 run

The following is the expected output. Note that although the tasks
are created in a shuffled order, they run from highest to lowest.

    Hello from mainEdt()
    CREATE 0
    CREATE 1
    CREATE 0
    CREATE 1
    CREATE 0
    CREATE 1
    CREATE 0
    CREATE 1
    CREATE 0
    CREATE 1
