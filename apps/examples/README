** Adding examples 

- Please, do not commit large input files in this folder.


** Testing

The test script looks for makefiles containing an
'all-test' target. If this target is present the example
becomes part of the non-regression examples test-set.

If for some reasons an example testing is to be temporarily 
disabled, add the path to the Makefile relative to current folder
in the 'ocrTestsExamples.ignored' file.
