# BUILD
###

To build:
    - TARGET=<target> make -f Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 install
    - <target> can be one of serial, naive-parallel, bounded-parallel or bounded-parallel-db
    - By default, bounded-parallel-db will be built

Options:
    - You can modify Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 or set appropriate environment
      variables to override where the program is built (WORKLOAD_BUILD) and
      installed (WORKLOAD_INSTALL) as well as where OCR resides (OCR_INSTALL_ROOT
      and OCR_BUILD_ROOT) and which implementation of OCR to use (OCR_TARGET)

###
# RUN
###

To run:
    - Go to install/
    - Set up appropriate environment variables (printed when you do a make install)
    - Run the executable. Currently n should be < 23

Example:
    - ./bounded-parallel-db -n 22 -c
    - ./bounded-parallel-db -h (to list all options)
