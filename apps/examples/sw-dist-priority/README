This version of Smith-Waterman has been modified to use distribution (affinity)
hints, as well as task priorities. The main work task also has an extra sleep
routine added so as to make a human-recognizable delay, and some extra printf
calls are included to make an execution trace.

The BAD_AFFINITIES environment variable controls the priorities used. The
affinity is always row-block-cyclic. Setting BAD_AFFINITIES=0 makes the
priorities match the affinities, whereas BAD_AFFINITIES=1 makes the priority
hints clash with the row-block-cyclic affinities.

Use the included run.sh to run the program.
