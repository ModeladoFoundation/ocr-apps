# RMD Strawman ("Sunshine++") configuration file for F_SIM
#
# This file demonstrates how to set various parameters for the simulator to exercise with.
#
# Parameters have scoping rules - closer to actual specific agents in the block over-ride global settings.
#
# For example, the "verbose" flag may be over-ridden by later stages of configuration.  The global setting
# is least-binding, while the per-unit setting is most binding.  So if a specific agent setting says "be
# verbose", then it does not matter what other settings indicated.
