This is alternative implementation of CoMD from SDSC done as part of XSTACK program and is incomplete due to time constraints.
    *Much more asynchronous than the other CoMD implementation from SDSC (checked in under sdsc/)
    *Only Lennard-Jones Potential is implemented.
    *There could be potential bugs lurking around.

To build and run:
make -f Makefile.<OCR_TYPE> clean run
E.g., OCR_TYPE=x86 or x86-mpi
make -f Makefile.x86 clean run

Change WORKLOAD_ARGS to run different problem sizes. See, Makefile.x86
