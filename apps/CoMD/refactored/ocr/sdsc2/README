This is alternative implementation of CoMD from SDSC done as part of XSTACK program and is incomplete due to time constraints.
    *Much more asynchronous than the other CoMD implementation from SDSC (checked in under sdsc/)
    *Only Lennard-Jones Potential is implemented.

LOG
=====
* Chandra: 11/23/2015 - Checked in original implemenation "as is"
* Chandra: 02/15/2016 - Fixed bugs in the original implementation to run on distributed OCR
=====


To build and run:
make -f Makefile.<OCR_TYPE> clean run
E.g., OCR_TYPE=x86 or x86-mpi
make -f Makefile.x86 clean run

Change WORKLOAD_ARGS to run different problem sizes. See, Makefile.x86
