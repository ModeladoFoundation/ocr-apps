CoMD with MPI-Lite can be built 3 ways

1. in this directory
	make OCR_TYPE=x86 install

	comd-mpi executable shows up in ./install/x86

	make OCR_TYPE=x86 run   #runs it

2. in build_and_run/mpi
	make OCR_TYPE=x86 install

	comd-mpi executable shows up in ./build_and_run/mpi/install/x86

	make OCR_TYPE=x86 run   #runs it

3. To use Distributed OCR; in this directory
	make OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi install

	comd-mpi executable shows up in ./install/x86-mpi

	make OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi run   #runs it

to obtain a number of policy domains different from the default 2:
OCR_NUM_NODES=5 make OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi run

and to use different machines in the cluster, make a file, e.g., named 4nodes,
whose content is 4 cluster machine names, like
bar4
bar5
bar6
bar6

and set the number of nodes to the same value as names in the file (you can
repeat a name, like bar6)
OCR_NUM_NODES=4 OCR_NODEFILE=4nodes make OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi run

---
For running with multiple numbers of ranks, you can go to ./examples

mpi-install-SS.sh - builds comd-mpi using the Makefile in .., and runs StrongScaling 1,2,4,8,16
mpi-runapp-SS.sh - builds comd-mpi using the Makefile in ../build_and_run/mpi, and runs StrongScaling 1,2,4,8,16

** These should produce the same results! Just different directory structures.
