CoMD with MPI-Lite can be built 2 ways

1. in this directory
	make OCR_TYPE=x86-pthread-x86 install

	comd-mpi executable shows up in ./install

	make OCR_TYPE=x86-pthread-x86 run   #runs it

2. in build_and_run/mpi
	make OCR_TYPE=x86-pthread-x86 CoMD

	CoMD executable shows up there

	make OCR_TYPE=x86-pthread-x86 run   #runs it

For running with multiple numbers of ranks, you can go to ./examples

mpi-install-SS.sh - builds comd-mpi using the Makefile in .., and runs StrongScaling 1,2,4,8,16
mpi-runapp-SS.sh - builds CoMD using the Makefile in ../build_and_run/mpi, and runs StrongScaling 1,2,4,8,16

** These should produce the same results! Just different directory structures.
