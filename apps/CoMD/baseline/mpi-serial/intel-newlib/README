This version of CoMD is identical to the original doe application (doe-original)
except that it relies on newlib which runs on top of OCR.

To compile:
    - Build newlib in apps/libs/src:
        - cd ../../../../apps/libs/src/newlib
        - ARCH=x86 make all install
    - Build the ocrshim library (temporary step):
        - cd ocrshim
        - make all install
    - Build this application
        - make

The executable will be called CoMD-serial and will be located in install/x86.

The pots directory is in ../../../datasets.

Note: Currently, newlib uses a OCR-shim layer for demonstration purposes; this
will be replaced by the OCR runtime.
