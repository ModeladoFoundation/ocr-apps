This version of CoMD is identical to the original doe application (doe-original)
except that it relies on newlib which runs on top of OCR.

To compile:
    - Build newlib in apps/libs/src:
        - cd xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib
        - make ARCH=x86 all install
    - Build the ocrscaffold library (temporary step):
        - cd xstack/apps/libs/src/ocrscaffold
        - make ARCH=x86 all install
    - Build this application
        - make

The executable will be called CoMD-serial and will be located in install/x86.

The pots directory is in ../../../datasets.

Note: Currently, CoMD uses a ocrscaffold layer for demonstration purposes; this
will be replaced by the OCR runtime.

------------------------
CoMD with glibc:

These is also a way to build CoMD and link it against glibc.  To build:
    - Build newlib in apps/libs/src:
        - cd xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib
        - make ARCH=x86 all install
    - Build the ocr-glibc shim library:
        - cd xstack/apps/libs/src/ocr-glibc
        - make all install
    - Build the ocrscaffold library (temporary step):
        - cd xstack/apps/libs/src/ocrscaffold
        - make ARCH=x86_glibc all install
    - Build this application
        - make -f Makefile.x86_glibc

Note: Currently, CoMD uses a ocrscaffold layer for demonstration purposes; this
will be replaced by the OCR runtime.
