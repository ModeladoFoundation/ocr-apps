This directory contains the following files:
 - rhs4sh.c: contains the original code of a core kernel in SW4. The kernel has been augmented with R-Stream pragmas instructing the compiler to automatically optimize and parallelize the core functions.
 - rhs4sg.gen.c: the result of the automatic optimization and parallelization performed by R-Stream. The parallelization is achieved using OCR.
 - micro_kernels.c: a set of utility functions in charge of setting up and starting the program.

To build the program, simply run make.
