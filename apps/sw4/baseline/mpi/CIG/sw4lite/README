sw4lite is a very simplified version of SW4 intended for trying out various performance optimizations.

To build
--------

The Makefiles are what I use at LLNL, you will have to modify them to suit your system.

Type:
make
to build the code. The executable will be named optimize/sw4g.

A debug version can be built by
make debug=yes
which will be located at debug/sw4g

To build with only C code, type:
make nofort=yes
The executable will be optimize_c/sw4g

To build with OpenMP type:
make openmp=yes
The executable will be optimize_omp/sw4g

The Cuda version is built by
make -f Makefile.cuda
and the executable will be under optimize_cuda/sw4g

To run
------
An example input file is under tests/pointsource/pointsource.in, which solves the elastic wave equation for
a single point source in a free space or half space. The input file is given as argument to the executable, as in the example:

mpirun -np 16 sw4g pointsource.in

Output from a run is provided at tests/pointsource/pointsource.out.
For this point source example, the analytical solution is known. The error is printed at the end:

Errors at time 0.6 Linf = 0.569416 L2 = 0.0245361 norm of solution = 3.7439

when modifying the code, it is important to make sure that these numbers are not changed.

Some timings are also output. For each MPI process the following are given in seconds: A total execution time for the time stepping loop, time spent imposing boundary conditions (BC total), and time spent evaluating the difference scheme (Step), and time doing output during the computation (Image&Time series).


The code under tests/testil is a stand alone single-core program that runs the computational kernel only, and outputs timings.
