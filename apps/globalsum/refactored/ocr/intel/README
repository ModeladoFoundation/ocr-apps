This directory provides an implementation of computing global sums.
The parameter ARITY is defined in ocrGS.h as 2 which yields a binary tree.
The code has been tested with higher values of ARITY which reduces the number of EDTs created but also reduces the amount of parallelism

gsLib.c : both the global sum computation code and the initialization code

GSsharedBlock.h: definition of the "shared block" which is both used and passed through

ocrGS.h: contains the ARITY of the tree, the structure definition for the gsBlocks and 3 prototypes: GSiEdt, GSxEdt, and computeInitEdt
    to change the ARITY of the tree, you must recompile both the source code and gsLib.c
    This file also contains the definitions of
  M the number of datapoints for each worker
  N the number of workers
  T the maximum number of timesteps (the preconditioned version will stop early)

Any driver code for the global sum library must:
   create the computeInitEdt
   set numnodes in GSsharedBLock
   launch GSiEDT before going parallel
GSiEDT creates the tree of size numnodes
GSiEDT inializes the gsBlock
GSiEDT returns to the parallel computation through a copy of computeInitEdt
   computeInitEdt launches its copy of of the real compute code (cgEdt in this case)

cgEdt implements conjugate gradients
   the matrix is diagonal with diagonal element equal to its row number (starting with 1)
   the right had side is equal to this same row number so the answer is all 1s

   cgEdt has three phases.
   the last two alternate until the timestep limit is reached with a global sum between each phase.

   after T iterations, each compute node prints out its x values (which should be close to 1)

There are THREE driver versions in this directory

cgNoShim.c   is the prefered implementation where rtrold is updated "out of phase" to avoid a race condition

cgShim.c     creates a serial "shimEdt" between the end of the global sum and the return to parallelism just to do
             the update of rtrold safely.  As shown by cgNoShim.c it is not needed in this example but was included
             here to show how it could be done if needed in some other context

a third driver pcg.c is provided.  It implements preconditioned conjugate gradients with a diagonal preconditioner
where the diagonal elements of the preconditioner are 1 larger than the diagonal of the matrix.

This requires THREE global sums per iteration but converges much faster.

The bash script go.sh invokes all three versions of the code in x86 and mpi modes
