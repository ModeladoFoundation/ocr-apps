This is a small test suite for MPI-Lite on FFWD-2.  Many of these tests were
originally part of the FFWD-1 MPI-Lite unit tests.

The tests are all executed by the Makefile in this directory.
The last line contains the number of pass/fails.

        % make > test.log 2>&1

Each test has its own directory, and its own makefile.
The tests can be executed individually from their own directory as well.

        % cd mpi_comm1
        % make OCR_TYPE=x86


If you wish to add a test to this suite, please follow these conventions.
1. create a directory with a meaningful name (not "test").
2. place your sources in the directory.
3. copy a makefile from one of the other directories, and update it for your test.
        - change TARGET and the verification criteria in the "grep".
4. test!
5. add your directory name to the top-level makefile.
