Building libcxx for tg, and x86
=====================

This directory can build libcxx for two different architectures:
1 - tg; this is for the xstg-linux-elf target and uses the new
    llvm/clang/binutils tool chain in the intel repository:isa/4.1.0 branch.
2 - x86; this is for the x86_64-linux-elf target and uses the
    same toolchain as above.

Note that the builds for each of these 'targets' is independent of the others.
You don't need to do anything special if you want to build libcxx for more
than one of these.

Also note that first, newlib must be built and installed for the appropriate
architecture.
Build newlib for 'tg' for libcxx 'tg', and 'x86' for libcxx 'x86'
=====================
To build for either architecture:

Change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/libcxx directory.
Run 'make ARCH=<arch>'; where <arch> is one of 'tg' or 'x86'. This builds
for the specified target and installs the resulting library and includes
into the install root at xstack/apps/libs/<arch>.

After the build completes, the following has been copied into the
xstack/apps/libs/<arch>/lib/ directory:

   libc++.a

The xstack/apps/libs/<arch>/include directory is also populated with
C++ headers under c++/.

To just do a local build, but not install, run 'make ARCH=tg build'.

To clean, use 'make ARCH=<arch> clean'.  Note that this does NOT uninstall
from the xstack/apps/libs/<arch> install root area.
