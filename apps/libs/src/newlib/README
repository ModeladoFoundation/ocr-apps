Building newlib for tg, x86, and x86_clang
=====================

This directory can build newlib for three different 'targets':
1 - tg; this is for the xstg target and uses the new llvm/clang/binutils
       tool chain in the intel repository:isa/4.1.0 branch.
2 - x86; this is for the x86 target and uses the new llvm/clang/binutils
       tool chain in the intel repository:isa/4.1.0 branch.
3 - x86_native; this is for the x86 target and uses the native x86 tool chain;
       this has only been checked out using the gcc tool chain, revisions
       4.7, 4.8, and 4.9.
Note that the builds for each of these 'targets' is independent of the others.
You don't need to do anything special if you want to build newlib for more
than one of these.
=====================

To build for the xstg architecture, change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib
directory.  Run 'make ARCH=tg'; this builds for the xstg target.  Then run
'make ARCH=tg install'; this deposits resulting libraries and includes into
the install root at xstack/apps/libs/tg.

After the build completes, the following is in the
xstack/apps/libs/tg/lib/ directory:

   crt0.o  crt0t.o crtend.o libc.a  libg.a  libm.a  libnosys.a  nosys.specs

The xstack/apps/libs/tg/include directory is also populated with
standard 'libc' headers.

To clean, use 'make ARCH=tg clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the xstack/apps/libs/tg area.

=====================

To build for x86, change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib directory.
Run 'make ARCH=x86'; this builds for the x86 target. Then run
'make ARCH=x86 install'; this deposits resulting libraries and includes
into xstack/apps/libs/x86.

After the build completes, the following is in the
xstack/apps/libs/x86/lib/ directory:

       crt0.o  libc.a  libg.a  libm.a  libnosys.a  nosys.specs

The xstack/apps/libs/x86/include directory is also populated with
standard 'libc' headers.

To clean use 'make ARCH=x86 clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the xstack/apps/libs/x86 area.

=====================

To build for x86_native, change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib directory.
Run 'make ARCH=x86_native'; this builds for the x86 target. Then run
'make ARCH=x86_native install'; this deposits resulting libraries and includes
into xstack/apps/libs/x86_native.

After the build completes, the following is in the
xstack/apps/libs/x86_native/lib/ directory:

       crt0.o  libc.a  libg.a  libm.a  libnosys.a  nosys.specs

The xstack/apps/libs/x86_native/include directory is also populated with
standard 'libc' headers.

To clean use 'make ARCH=x86_native clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the xstack/apps/libs/x86_native area.
