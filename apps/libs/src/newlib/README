Building newlib for tg, x86, and x86_clang
=====================

This directory can build newlib for three different 'targets':
1 - tg; this is for the xstg target and uses the new llvm/clang/binutils
       tool chain in the intel repository:isa/4.1.0 branch.
2 - x86; this is for the x86 target and uses the native x86 tool chain;
       this has only been checked out using the gcc tool chain, revisions
       4.7, 4.8, and 4.9.
3 - x86_clang; this is for the x86 target and uses the new llvm/clang/binutils
       tool chain in the intel repository:isa/4.1.0 branch.

=====================

To build for the xstg architecture, change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib
directory.  Run 'make ARCH=tg'; this builds for the xstg target.  Then run
'make ARCH=tg install'; this deposits resulting libraries and includes into
xstack/apps/libs/tg.

After the build completes, the following is in the
xstack/apps/libs/tg/lib/ directory:

       crt0.o  libc.a  libg.a  libm.a  libnosys.a  nosys.specs

The xstack/apps/libs/tg/include directory is also populated with
standard 'libc' headers.

To clean use 'make ARCH=tg clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the xstack/apps/libs/tg area.

=====================

To build for x86, change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib directory.
Run 'make ARCH=x86'; this builds for the x86 target. Then run
'make ARCH=x86 install'; this deposits resulting libraries and includes
into xstack/apps/libs/x86.

After the build completes, the following is in the
xstack/apps/libs/x86/lib/ directory:

       crt0.o  libc.a  libg.a  libm.a  libnosys.a  nosys.specs

The xstack/apps/libs/x86/include directory is also populated with
standard 'libc' headers.

To clean use 'make ARCH=x86 clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the xstack/apps/libs/x86 area.

=====================

To build for x86_clang, change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/newlib directory.
Run 'make ARCH=x86_clang'; this builds for the x86 target. Then run
'make ARCH=x86_clang install'; this deposits resulting libraries and includes
into xstack/apps/libs/x86_clang.

After the build completes, the following is in the
xstack/apps/libs/x86_clang/lib/ directory:

       crt0.o  libc.a  libg.a  libm.a  libnosys.a  nosys.specs

The xstack/apps/libs/x86_clang/include directory is also populated with
standard 'libc' headers.

To clean use 'make ARCH=x86_clang clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the xstack/apps/libs/x86_clang area.
