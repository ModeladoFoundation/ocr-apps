Building libunwind for tg, and x86
=====================

This directory can build libunwind for two different architectures:
1 - tg; this is for the xstg-linux-elf target and uses the new
    llvm/clang/binutils tool chain in the intel repository:isa/4.1.0 branch.
2 - x86; this is for the x86_64-linux-elf target and uses the
    same toolchain as above.

Note that the builds for each of these 'targets' is independent of the others.
You don't need to do anything special if you want to build libunwind for more
than one of these.

Also note that first, newlib, libcxx, and libcxxabi must be built and
installed for the appropriate architecture.
Build newlib for 'tg' for libunwind 'tg', and 'x86_clang' for libunwind 'x86'
Build libcxx for 'tg' for libunwind 'tg', and 'x86' for libunwind 'x86'
Build libcxxabi for 'tg' for libunwind 'tg', and 'x86' for libunwind 'x86'
=====================
To build for either architecture:

Change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/libunwind directory.
Run 'make ARCH=<arch>'; where <arch> is one of 'tg' or 'x86'. This builds
for the specified target and installs the resulting library and includes
into the install root at xstack/apps/libs/<arch>.

After the build completes, the following has been copied into the
xstack/apps/libs/<arch>/lib/ directory:

   libunwind.a

No headers are installed.

To just do a local build, but not install, run 'make ARCH=tg build'.

To clean, use 'make ARCH=<arch> clean'.  Note that this does NOT uninstall
from the xstack/apps/libs/<arch> install root area.
