LLVM XSTG Unwinding Design Notes
Stack unwinding is used both by C++ exceptions and by Gdb to role back the stack to a previous state.

Structures/Tables
Various structures and tables are included in ELF object files to facilitate stack unrolling in various contexts. The structures are generated by the compiler and assembler (via compiler directives) and collected into tables via the linker script used.

EH Tables
.eh_frame
This table is generated and included in a read-only data section when the --exception compiler flag is set, which is the default for C++. The table defines per-function stack frames, providing info to allow each frame to be 'unwound'.

To display contents: objdump -s -j .eh_frame xxx.o

.gcc_except_table
They provide per function description of function exception handling points.
