= Description =

Provides basic timer service for OCR Applications and Benchmarks.

The print format is parsable by various scripts under tests to generate reports.


= Limitations =

On distributed-OCR, a timer call gives the time as returned on the currently executing machine.
The library doesn't guarantee any form of time synchronization across multiple machines.
