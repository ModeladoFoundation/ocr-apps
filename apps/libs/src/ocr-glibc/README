Building the ocr-glibc libraries (x86 ONLY)
=====================

To build for x86, change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/ocr-glibc directory.
Run 'make' and 'make install'; this deposits resulting libraries into
xstack/apps/libs/x86.

After the build completes, the following is in the
xstack/apps/libs/x86/lib/ directory:

       libocr-glibc.a   libocr-glibcxx.a

To clean use 'make clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build results
from the xstack/apps/libs/x86 area.
