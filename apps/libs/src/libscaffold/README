Building the lib scaffold library for tg-xe, x86, and x86-test.

The scaffold libraries are replacements (very simple) for a real runtime
They may work as a replacement for either the ocr or tgr runtimes. It is
a scaffold built upon syscalls (for x86 versions) or libswtest (for the
tg-xe version).

=====================

To build for tg-xe, change into the apps/libs/src/libscaffold
directory.  Run 'make ARCH=tg-xe'; this builds for the tg-xe target
with ocr support and automatically installs it. If you want to build for
tgr support, add USE_TGR=yes to the command line.

After the build completes, the following is in the
apps/apps/libs/install/tg-xe/lib directory:

       libscaffold.a

To clean use 'make ARCH=tg-xe clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the apps/apps/libs/install/tg-xe/lib area.

=====================

To build for x86, change into the apps/libs/src/libscaffold
directory.  Run 'make ARCH=x86'; this builds for the x86 target
with ocr support and automatically installs it. If you want to build for
tgr support, add USE_TGR=yes to the command line.

After the build completes, the following is in the
apps/apps/libs/install/tg-xe/lib directory:

       libscaffold.a

To clean use 'make ARCH=x86 clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the apps/apps/libs/install/x86/lib area.

=====================

To build for x86-test, change into the apps/libs/src/libscaffold
directory.  Run 'make ARCH=x86-test'; this builds for the x86-test target
with ocr support and automatically installs it. If you want to build for
tgr support, add USE_TGR=yes to the command line.

After the build completes, the following is in the
apps/apps/libs/install/tg-xe/lib directory:

       libscaffold.a

To clean use 'make ARCH=x86-test clean'.  Note that this does NOT remove build
results from the apps/apps/libs/install/x86-test/lib area.
