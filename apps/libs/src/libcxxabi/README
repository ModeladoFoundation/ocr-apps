Building libcxxabi for tg, and x86
=====================

This directory can build libcxxabi for two different architectures:
1 - tg; this is for the xstg-linux-elf target and uses the new
    llvm/clang/binutils tool chain in the intel repository:isa/4.1.0 branch.
2 - x86; this is for the x86_64-linux-elf target and uses the
    same toolchain as above.

Note that the builds for each of these 'targets' is independent of the others.
You don't need to do anything special if you want to build libcxxabi for more
than one of these.

Also note that first, newlib and libcxx must be built and installed for the
appropriate architecture.
Build newlib for 'tg' for libcxxabi 'tg', and 'x86_clang' for libcxxabi 'x86'
Build libcxx for 'tg' for libcxxabi 'tg', and 'x86' for libcxxabi 'x86'
=====================
To build for either architecture:

Change into the xstack/apps/libs/src/libcxxabi directory.
Run 'make ARCH=<arch>'; where <arch> is one of 'tg' or 'x86'. This builds
for the specified target and installs the resulting library and includes
into the install root at xstack/apps/libs/<arch>.

After the build completes, the following has been copied into the
xstack/apps/libs/<arch>/lib/ directory:

   libc++abi.a

A couple of include files are also installed in the xstack/apps/libs/<arch>/include/c++/v1 directory.

To just do a local build, but not install, run 'make ARCH=tg build'.

To clean, use 'make ARCH=<arch> clean'.  Note that this does NOT uninstall
from the xstack/apps/libs/<arch> install root area.
