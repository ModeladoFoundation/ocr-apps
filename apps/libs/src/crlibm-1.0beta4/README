Here is how to build the crlibm-1.0beta4 for x86 and tg

This will get you to the initial checkout state:

	ARCH=x86 make uninstall clean squeaky
	ARCH=tg  make uninstall clean squeaky

This will untar the crlibm-1.0beta4 package and configure and build it:

	ARCH=x86 make configure all check
	ARCH=tg  make configure all

This will install the libraries and include files in their standards directories

	ARCH=x86 make install
	ARCH=tg  make install

Then to run a sanity check for the following ORC_TYPEs x86, tg-x86 and tg:

	OCR_TYPE=x86 make -C ocr  clean all run
	OCR_TYPE=tg-x86  make -C ocr  clean all run
	OCR_TYPE=tg              make -C ocr  clean all run

Note that running the sanity checks will also build the lib if not already built
