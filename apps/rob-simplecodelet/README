This is a simple test to exercise codelet scheduling across one or more
blocks.  The key differences are in simple(): if there is no yield,
it terminates very quickly and ends up disproportionately scheduled on
low-numbered cores.  With the nested for() to waste time, it's better.
With a usleep (of 1 or 3 us), it's mostly proportionate as one would expect.
sched_yield() makes little difference (see Rob or Justin for explanation).

A nice way to see the results is:

 ./stest -c [configfile].cfg | grep simple | sort | uniq -c
