# WORKLOAD_ARGS and WORKLOAD_INPUTS are available

# $(eval WORKLOAD_INPUTS := something) or
# $(eval WORKLOAD_INPUTS := $(shell <script>))
# The second syntax will execute <script> and assign
# its output to WORKLOAD_INPUTS
#
# You may also want to assign a value to WORKLOAD_OUTS
# which should contain the list of output files produced
# by the application (to be passed to postrun). This is
# taken-care of for you on FSim but not on any of the
# other platforms.
