This OCR implementation of XSBENCH.

This follows the reference MPI+OpenMP implementation as closely as possible.

It exploits the "shared" memory for parallelism within a node by sharing datablocks in read-only access to compute the lookup operations.
This is similar to the OpenMP implementaion wherein a large chunk of memory is created to store the data and the threads access it in
read-only mode to do the lookups. The OCR implementation has both OpenMP-like "static" and "dynamic" (with configurable chunk size) loop schedulers
implemented as a task graph.
