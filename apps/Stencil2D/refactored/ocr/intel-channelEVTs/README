Stencil-2D implementation based on Channel-Events

= Compiling the application =

== Optimizations ==

* STENCIL_WITH_EAGER_DB: Use eager datablock hint (need gerrit patch 3536)
* STENCIL_WITH_DBUF_CHRECV: Use double buffering for both DBs and Channels. Allows satisfy on channel to be asynchronous when eager is on.
* CHANNEL_EVENTS_AT_RECEIVER: Whether the channel used to do the halo exchange is sender or receiver-based

== Debug mode ==

Set FULL_APP preprocessor variable to 0 to run the app as an OCR-skeleton - doing so will disable all the
computations and the app only sets up the OCR tasks and thus helps to measure OCR overhead

In Makefile.<OCR_TYPE>
CFLAGS += -DFULL_APP=0 //To measure only the OCR overhead
or
CFLAGS += -DFULL_APP=1 //To measure the full app performance


= Running the application =

Support for OCR_TYPE: x86, x86-mpi, tg-x86, tg

Program Arguments:
* points       : Total number of points 'P' on each axis of the domain
* subdomains   : Numbers of subdomains to decompose the domain into.
                 Contains P*P points
* timesteps    : Number of iterations

Invocation examples:

# Default run:

  make -f Makefile.${OCR_TYPE} run

  To run on TG/Fsim:
  OCR_XE_CONFIG=`pwd`/xe.cfg OCR_CE_CONFIG=`pwd`/ce.cfg make -f Makefile.tg clean run

# Command-line overriden arguments:

  WORKLOAD_ARGS="1024 6 100" make -f Makefile.${OCR_TYPE} run

= Application Workflow =

C   = creation
S   = satisfy
c   = channel event (sender-sided i.e. satisfy operation is local)
(F) = defines a finish scope
