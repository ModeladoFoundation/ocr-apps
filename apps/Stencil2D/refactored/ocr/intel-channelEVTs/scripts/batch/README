TPLARG_*: overrides value that are sed into the batch template


BATCH_TPL: The name of the template file (without its tpl extensions) to use located under ./scripts/batch
CPGN: The folder whereto output the generated file and run experiments from


MHOME: Allows to override the 'home' value. Essentially useful on NERSC system when using the SCRATCH space.

OCR to link with:
Either OCR_INSTALL







- OCR_INSTALL to be set or default variant is used
- CPGN:
- Default app variant name

- Would have liked to extract the application specific parameters and call into a generic function to call gen/run/res

genBatch.sh
	=> has both application and jobs specific stuff
