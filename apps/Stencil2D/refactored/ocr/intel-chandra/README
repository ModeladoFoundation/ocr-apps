Running:

make -f Makefile.<OCR_TYPE> run

where OCR_TYPE can be
x86
x86-mpi
tg-x86
tg

#Edit the WORKLOAD_ARGS variable in the corresponding Makefile.OCR_TYPE to change the problem size/iterations

Set FULL_APP preprocessor variable to 0 to run the app as an OCR-skeleton - doing so will disable all the
computations and the app only sets up the OCR tasks and thus helps to measure OCR overhead

In stencil_2d.c
#define FULL_APP 0 //To measure only the OCR overhead
or
#define FULL_APP 1 //To measure the full app performance

To use AFFINITY (experimental OCR) API:
1. Modify Makefile.x86-mpi
    CFLAGS := -g -DENABLE_EXTENSION_AFFINITY
