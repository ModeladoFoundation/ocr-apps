Stencil2D with Bamboo/Tarragon

This program tests the efficiency of a simple 2D stencil update.
It employs a 2D decomposition of the space interval.
Halo exchange uses MPI_Isend/Irecv using Bamboo/Tarragon.


To build and run this test, type

	% make


Bamboo, Tarragon and ROSE can be found in /opt/bamboo_6_0 on xstack.exascale-tech.com.

If you do not wish to use the Makefile,use these command instead.
Refer to http://bamboo.ucsd.edu/documentation.html for additional information
on the commands below.

% /opt/bamboo_6_0/bin/bamboo-translate -I. stencil.c
% /opt/bamboo_6_0/bin/bamboo-cxx  -I. -o bamboo_stencil bamboo_stencil.cpp MPI_bail_out.c wtime.c
% /opt/bamboo_6_0/bin/bamboo-run -w 4 -x 4 ./bamboo_stencil 4 6


For the bamboo-run command:
	-w 	is the number of workers. Workers are a single kernel level thread,
		which is mapped to a core.
	-x	is the number of Bamboo tasks, which must be >= the number of ranks.


The Stencil program takes as input the length of the grid, and the number of iterations.
The grid is a square.


	bamboo_stencil  < length of grid > <# iterations>




Bamboo is a custom source-to-source translator, built using the ROSE Compiler
Infrastructure, that transforms MPI C/C++ source into a data-driven form that
automatically overlaps communication with available computation.  For more
information, see http://bamboo.ucsd.edu/.

Tarragon is a runtime library which executes a task graph.  For more information,
see http://rosecompiler.org/ROSE_ResearchPapers/Nguyen12-Bamboo-SC12.pdf.

ROSE is an open source compiler infrastructure to build source-to-source program
transformation and analysis tools for large-scale applications. For more information,
