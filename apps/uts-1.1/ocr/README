This is the hand translation of the uts benchmark to OCR using continuations.

The Makefile.x86 builds a serial, by hand attempt to be an OCR compiler of the code.

In Makefile.x86 if you change -DPARALLEL_off to -DPARALLEL you will get a parallel version of the code.
The parallel version does the next depth set if recursive calls in parallel.

This code is still under develepment and could use some cleaning up and readability edits.

TODO:
(1) is get the other makefiles working.
(2) understand the performance issues
    currently there is a 1:2:4:7 ratio of slowdowns
    from serial 1 worker : serial 8 workers : parallel 1 worker : parallel 8 workers
    while it would be expected that the ratio should be 1:1:1+:1-

P.S.
the j.sh script shows how to rebuild and run the two cases of 1 worker and 8 workers.:w
