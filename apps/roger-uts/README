TODO:
	(1) try multi-block simulation
	(2) allocation of data block allocation in DRAM
	(3) continue to work to get larger problems to run

------------------------------------------------------------------
F_SIM:

make clean;make;make run;grep CONSOLE logs/*CE*
will build and run uts on the simulator

-DRAG_SIM controls changes needed to run on simulator

-DDEBUG enables a lot of detailed output
-DTRACE enables a more modest amount of debug output

By default the data blocks are allocated in the XE's SPAD
-DRAG_BLOCK moves the allocation to the BLOCK memory shared by the XE's

By default the Tree depth is 6
-DRAG_DEPTH=#  will change this.

Currently with DBs in SPAD, the max that works is -DRAG_DEPTH=4
and with DBs in BLOCK, the max that works is -DRAG_DEPTH=5

------------------------------------------------------------------
AFL:

make -f Makefile.afl clean; make -f Makefile.afl ; make -f Makefile.afl run;
will build and run uts on linux using the AFL.

-DRAG_AFL controls changes needed to run on AFL

------------------------------------------------------------------
POWER:

Makefile.power is Ganesh's for doing power measurement runs.
