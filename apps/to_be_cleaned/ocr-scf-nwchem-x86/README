SCF-NWCHEM for OCRx86 using API v. 0.8, August 2013.

- Copy the folder in xstack/ocr/runtime/ocr-x86/examples

- CD to xstack/ocr/runtime/ocr-x86 and set up:

	export OCR_INSTALL=${PWD}/ocr-install
  	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${OCR_INSTALL}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

- Compile using make. Compilation flags are also available as make DYNAMIC_SCHED=1. See Makefile for the other flags.

- Execute using make run

- The number of atoms and threads is hardcoded in the main function. It would be updated to grab these values from argv in a future version when a stable example shows it how.

- Currently, there are limitations in memory (some tests showed that goes up to 48 threads and 23 atoms).
