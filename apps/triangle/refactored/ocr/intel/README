This code implements a recursive search of the game tree of the "14 peg puzzle"
to count the number of solutions.

The board starts with 14 pegs and one open spot in a 5x5 triangle.  The goal is
to jump and remove one peg at a time leaving only one left.  Traditionally the
hole is at the top of the triangle:

        0
      1   1
    1   1   1
  1   1   1   1
1   1   1   1   1

which leads to 29760 unique solutions, but it can be solved with the hole
placed anywhere.  The most solutions is with the hole at the middle of the bottom
(or either of the other two sides of course).

The depth of the tree is 13
The branching factor varies but the largest found was 10
The total number of nodes in the search tree is almost 1.3 million

The code does the increment with EW mode which requires LOCKABLE datablocks, but that is now the default.

Becausae of the shared nature of datablocks, each instantiation of triangleTask needs to have a separate
board.  To avoid using a datablock in the EDT in which it was created, this is accomplished by
having and EDT create a new datablock for each legal move that is found.  The old and new boards are passed
into the new EDT along with the move number.  The new EDT copies the old board to the new board and makes
the move on the new board.  It then looks for legal moves.

However, because the existing board has been modified it cannot be passed to the new triangleEdt without
being released to make the changes visible.  Once it is released, it can no longer be examined to look for
other legal moves.  To break this deadlock, a ONCE event is created and each new EDT is made dependent
on the ONCE event.  After checking on all possible moves, the existing board is released and the event
is satisfied to wake up all the children (if any).



Structure of the code:

mainEDT creates realmainEDT and the various datablocks:
  counter: single word which is used to count the solutions
  oldboard: used to receive the existing board position
  board: used to make a copy of oldboard and then make the move
  pmoves: a Read Only list of possible moves

realmainEDT
  initializes the datablocks
  creates the first copy of triangleTask as a FINISH EDT
  creates wrapupTask which depends on triangleTask finishing

Since the first triangleTask is a finish EDT wrapup won't start until the count is complete

The btemp array which initializes the first board can be modified to try the hole in different places.

The following counts were obtained.
0: 29760  [the standard set up]
1: 14880
2: same as 1 by symmetry
3: 85258  [may require even more memory]
4: 1550
5-14: one of the above numbers

The program compares the count to 29760 so will report "FAIL" for the other cases.

There are no input parameters to the program so it should be executed by:

OCR_TYPE=x86 make run

It currently takes about 2.4  seconds to find all the solutions.

The code can be run on -mpi, but it takes about 4 minutes
I may investigate affinities to improve the performance or I may wait
for the better scheduler.
