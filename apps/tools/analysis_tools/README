= OCR runtime profiler-based analysis tools =

== Percent Scaling Loss ==

Performs a Percent Scaling Loss analysis based on OCR runtime profiler output.

Impl:
    psl/

Usage:
    ./profilerStatisticsDriver.sh $FOLDER

    - Look for ALL raw profile output files recursively in $FOLDER.
      Calls the profiler processing script if raw profile output files have not been processed yet. This step is done once unless the generated 'all.prof' files are manually deleted.

Output:
    For each function profiled, report the Percent Scaling Loss, for example:

        [8,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
        app_FNC_update    0.00%    90.79%    92.34%    89.93%    85.50%    79.81%    81.92%

    Shows the PSL for seven core configurations. The PSL is computed wrt to the
    eight cores baseline configuration. The output shows for each other
    configuration how much of the extra total execution time spent in the
    call 'app_FNC_update'. Thus, one can diagnose this particular call as being
    the main source of scaling loss in the application.


= OCR runtime metrics-based analysis tools =

Performs various analysis based no metrics output by the OCR runtime

== OCR worker idleness ==

Impl:
    metrics/

Usage:
    ./profilerStatisticsDriver.sh
