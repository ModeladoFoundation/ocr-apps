There are three versions of stencil 1D here:

stencil1Dsticky uses sticky events to transmit data
stencil1Donce uses once events (requires EDTs to spawn their GRANDCHILDREN)
stencil1Dguid sends the guid of the grandchild and doesn't use events at all

Copy whichever one you want to run to stencil1D.c

All implement a 1D dissapative stencil on a set of points
the initial data is 1s at each end and zero on the interior
there are three input parameters that are set in #define s



N is the number of worker EDTs that are created
M is the number of points controlled by each EDT
T is the number of iterations

They can be changed and rerun.
