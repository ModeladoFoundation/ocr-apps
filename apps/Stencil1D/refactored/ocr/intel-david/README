There are 3 versions of a 1D stencil computation
All three use "buffer" datablocks to exchange halo values between EDTs
All three use the "cloning" style in which a sequence of EDTs look after the same set of datapoints.
A new clone is launched at every iteration to gain access to the buffer blocks.
The bufferblocks are sent back at the end of an iteration.  The three versions are:

"sticky" which uses sticky events to pass the buffer block.  The sender satisfies the event while the receiver
makes its clone depend on the event.  A new event is created and sent with the halo data to facilitate the next
iteration.  sticky events are required because there is no order relationship between the adding of the dependence
and the satisfaction of the event.

"once" breaks the race condition by having an EDT clone its grandchild and adding the dependence before sending
the event (and halo data) to its neighbor.

"guid" doesn't use events at all.  Like "once" each EDT clones its grandchild but in the guid version,
it sends the guid of its grandchild with the halo data.  The other EDT can add the dependence directly
rather than satisfying an event.


There are three parameters (defined in stencil1D.h)
  N is the number of tasks
  M is the number of points in each task
  T is the number of iterations

The datapoints are initialized to zero except the boundary values which are set to 1
the particular stencil implemented is anew(i) = .5*(a(i+1) + a(i-1))
which implements an elliptic solver using the 2nd order three point finite difference.
The values converge (slowly) to all 1s.
If the stencil is wider than 3 points, then the number of shared boundary values
would have to be increased.

Control structure
  N stenciltask EDTs do the computation on M numbers each
  Each stencil task has a "real" datablock for computing values
  Each stencil has a private datablock to hold parameters
  Each stenciltask "clones" itself for each iteration
  Each stenciltask has two data blocks for sending data to each neighbor


Structure of code

mainEDT
  creates N datablocks of length 2M
  creates 2*N-2 datablocks for exchanging halo data and control information
  creates N private datablocks for local parameters
  launches wrapup that depends on realmain finishing
  launches realmain as a finish EDT

realmain
  creates N stencilEdts for the "sticky" version but creates 2*N Edts for the other two.
  initializes the data blocks
  launches the first N stencilEdt with the correct datablocks attached

Each stencil event
  if(iteration == 0) initializes data
  computes its new values using halo values as needed
  writes its boundary value(s) to the datablock(s)
  provides the data blocks to its neighbors in one of 3 ways

The values after final iteration are printed out in order by a wrapupEdt.
To make sure wrapup doesn't start early, it depends on realmain
which is declared to be a finish event (which means it
doesn't satisfy its output event until ALL of its descendents are finished).
