NAME:    stencil

PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency of a simple 1D stencil update
         It employs a 1D decomposition of the space interval.
         Each MPI ranks updates 1 chunk. Halo exchange uses MPI_Isend/Recv

         for (it = 0; it<NITER; it++) {
             exchange_halo (kstart-1; kend+1);
             u(i,t) = u(i,t-1) + 0.5 ( u(i+1,t-1) - u(i-1, t-1) )
             copy_halo ();
         }

USAGE:   The program takes as input the length of the interval,
         and the number of iterations on the interval

               <progname> < # grid points > <# iterations>

        # grid points has to be a multiple of NPROCS - 2, where NPROCS is the number of
        MPI ranks
