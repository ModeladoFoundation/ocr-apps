/*
This code does a 1D (3 point) stencil computation on a set of points
It takes as input:
NX is the number of points in each task
NITER is the number of timesteps

the datapoints are initialized to zero except the boundary values which are set to 1
the particular stencil implemented is anew(i) = a(i) + .5*(a(i+1)-a(i-1))

Known issue: This stencil is numerically unstable so that the values blow up over time. Keep NITER < 100
