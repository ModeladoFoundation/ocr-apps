This code does a 1D (3 point) stencil computation on a set of points

It takes as input:
NX is the number of points in each task
NITER is the number of timesteps

the datapoints are initialized to zero except the boundary values which are set to 1
the particular stencil implemented is anew(i) = 0.5*a(i) + .25*(a(i+1)+a(i-1))

This mimics an elliptic solver.  The values converge (slowly) to 1.0
