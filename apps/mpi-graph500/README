This is MPI graph, wrapped in AFL, (probably) working.  I have not yet
made sure that the threads are compatible with AFL's view of pthreads
-- they call the right setup, but I need to double-check.

Rather than use a cfg file, I hard-coded the parameters I wanted in
the AFL setup call.  So just run it with a scale number (and optionally
an edgefactor, etc.).
