This version of hpcg (and the reduction library) use EAGER datablocks.
You must have the EAGER patch for OCR checked out.

The recommended use for EAGER datablocks is:

1. Only use with channel events
2. The channel event should be owned by the receiver
3. The datablocks should be created once and reused

#3 required significant changes in the implementation

In particular, the datablock GUIDs are kept in the private (and reductionPrivate) datablocks.  They are unpacked as needed which required a new EDT in the reduction library and significant changes in haloExchangeEdt.
