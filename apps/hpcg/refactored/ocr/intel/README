OCR implementation of HPCG
Author David S. Scott

HPCG computes 50 iterations of the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve Ax = b, where A is a sparse matrix derived from a 27 point (3x3x3) stencil on a 3D grid of points.
See https://software.sandia.gov/hpcg/ for the benchmark.

The diagonal elements of A are set to 26 and all of the nonzero off diagonal elements are set to -1.  At the edge of the global grid, some of the -1s are missing but
the diagonal value is still set to 26 so the matrix is not singular.  The right hand side b is set to the row sums of the matrix so the solution is all 1s.

The matrix MUST be represented as a linear array of non zero elements with corresponding column indices.  The algorithm requires a sparse matrix vector product and 3 inner products
in addition to the precondioner.



Parallelism
The code assumes the grid consists of N = NPX x NPY x NPZ blocks of size MxMxM.  There are N workers, one for each block.

Inner products are implemented by reduceEDTs that start with one value from each worker and form a binary tree doing the additions.  The final result is then provided back to the workers

The matrix vector product requires a halo exchange in which boundary values are traded with up to 26 neighbors.

The preconditioner is 4 levels of multigrid using symmetric Gauss-Seidel sweeps


Events:
The code uses labeled GUIDs to create events, both for the halo exchanges and for the global sums.
It uses ordinary events for returning to the next phase.


Structure of the Code

mainEdt:	creates the shared datablock, launches realmainEdt and wrapupEdt
realmainEdt:	initializes the shared datablock and launches N initEdts with the shared block and "mynode" as a parameter

N copies of

InitEdt:	create the private block and launch hpcgInitEdt
hpcgInitEdt:	populate the private block and launch hpcgEdt

hpcgEdt:	written in a continuation style with a "phase" and a switch statement, each phase clones itself for the next phase

Phase0:		initialize and launch global sum for rtr
Phase1:		check convergence and launch mgEdt (preconditioner)
Phase2: 	launch global sum for rtz
Phase3:		launch halo exchange and spmv (sparse matrix vector product Ap)
Phase4:		launch global sum for pAp
Phase5:		launch global sum for rtr and return to phase 1 for next iteration

haloExchange:	launches packANDsatisfy, launches unpack
packANDsatisfy:	packs boundary values into small datablocks and satisfies events
unpack:		depends on the 26 events to receive the neighbors buffer blocks.  Puts the values in the vector.  Satisfies an event to wake up spmv
spmv:		actually do the matrix-vector product and satisfy an event to wake up the next phase


mgEdt		also written in a continuation style with both phase(6) and level (4).

Phase0:		launch Gauss-Seidel smoothing (starting with z=0) which depends on halo exchange (and pack and unpack) and then returns to phase 1 except at the lowest level when you return to Phase 3 of the higher level
Phase1:		launch spmv which depends on Halo Exchange (and pack and unpack) and returns to Phase 2
Phase2:		launch recursive call on smaller grid
Phase3: 	launch smoother with halo exchange
Phase4:		returns to next higher level (or Phase 3 or hpcg)


The algorithm will terminate, either after 50 iterations or if the residual gets small enough.
Each worker then delivers its part of the solution to wrapup which measures the variation from all 1s.

All of the parameters are currently #defined in the source code
It also #defines PRECONDITIONER.  If that is undefined, the code skips the preconditioning step
