R-Stream generated HPCG

Based on HPCG 3.0 (http://hpcg-benchmark.org/)

This directory contains the following files:
- hpcg.c: a C version of HPCG, augmented with R-Stream pragmas. This source file can be directly optimized and parallelized using the R-Stream compiler.- hpcg.gen.c: the optimized OCR version of the program that was automatically generated by the R-Stream compiler. This version is meant to run on a single node.
- hpcg.db.gen.c: the optimized OCR version of the program automatically generated by the R-Stream compiler. This version can run on several nodes since the compiler automatically performed data decomposition.
- micro_kernels.c: a set of utility functions in charge of setting up and starting the program.

The program runs on the dataset provided with the original benchmark.

This benchmark has been tested on OCR 1.1
