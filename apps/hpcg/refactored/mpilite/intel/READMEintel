High Performance Conjugate Gradient Benchmark (HPCG)
####################################################

version 3.0
Checked in by David S. Scott

Copied from ../../../baseline/mpi/sandia/hpcg-3.0 .
See that directory for more information about the benchmark,
history, tuning, etc.

to create an executable, do

OCR_TYPE=<type> make run   # where <type> is {x86, x86-mpi, tg}

in this directory.

This will create an MPI-Lite executable "hpcg" in the ./install/<type> directory
and run with the parameters from the hpcg.dat file copied into that directory.


HPCG benchmark input file
Sandia National Laboratories; University of Tennessee, Knoxville
104 104 104
60


That is currently set to a local brick size of 104x104x104

[If hpcg.dat is not in the directory with the executable, a much smaller
problem is done, taking less than a second.]

It should produce two output files, .txt and .yaml in ./install. .yaml has
the most interesting info; particularly the GFlops.

For x86, the number of ranks is defaulted to 4, or the value of
CONFIG_NUM_THREADS. This can be set explicitly via the WORKLOAD_ARGS variable.
