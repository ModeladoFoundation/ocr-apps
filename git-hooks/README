This directory is meant to have everyone use similar commit hooks.

To use:
    - The simplest way is to add a symlink:
        - Supposing you are at the root of your GIT repository
        - cd .git
        - mv hooks hooks_old
        - ln -s ../git-hooks hooks
    - You can also link to individual hooks or munge them your own way.


Current hooks:
    - pre-commit:
        - Fixes any trailing whitespace issue. This will reduce the number of fake
          differences
    - commit-msg:
        - Adds the ID line required by Gerrit
