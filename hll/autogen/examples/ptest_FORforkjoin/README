= The test script "ptest" assumes that the command " OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi make run"
  can be successfully run. If so, the performance test "ptest" creates a reference file
  "z_ref_output" which is what we expect the code to output.
  It then proceed to autogen the OCR code, run it and compare its output to the reference file.
  Upon success, zero is returned; otherwise whatever caused an error is returned.
= As it is now, this performance test mostly a performance framework designed
  to provide a reference SPMD setup.
= As usual, comment out the "rm -f z_*" line from the file "ptest" in order
  to be able to retain the generated OCR .c driver file "z_ptest_FORforkjoin.c"

= The file "ptest_FORforkjoin.h" has the following features:
    - If one comments out the macro constant "FFJ_ENABLE_AFFINITIES", no affinities
      will be used, i.e. the NULL_HINT value will be used instead.
    - The function "calculate_pid" is where the policy domain attribution
      calculated.  Provide your own function for a different attribution.
