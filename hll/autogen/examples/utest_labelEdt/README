= The test script "utest" assumes that the command " OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi make run"
  can be successfully run. If so, the unit test "btest" creates a reference file
  "z_ref_output" which is what we expect the code to output.
  It then proceed to autogen the OCR code, run it and compare its output to the reference file.
  Upon success, zero is returned; otherwise whatever caused an error is returned.
