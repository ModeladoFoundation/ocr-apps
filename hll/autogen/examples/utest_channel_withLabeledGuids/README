=The simple_channel_events is a 1D-2EDT exchange using channel events
 It has all the parts needed for a channel event 2-way exchange.

=The test script "btest" assumes that the command " OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi make run" can be successfully run.
 If so, the black box test "btest" creates a reference file "z_ref_output" which is what we expect the code to output.
 It then proceed to autogen the OCR code, run it and compare its output to the reference file.
 Upon success, zero is returned; otherwise whatever caused an error is returned.
