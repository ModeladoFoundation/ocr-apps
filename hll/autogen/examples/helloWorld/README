= The helloWorld black box test provide an introduction to autogen.
  The overall work is to factor a parabolic polynomial for its roots,
  remove duplicated roots, and print out the roots found.
  A single data block is in flight at all time.

= The file "y_helloworld.dot.png" shows the task and data flows.
  The original DOT file can be generated by enabling the corresponding
  switch in the "helloWorld.py" script. (See outputDot function)

= It has the following tasks, in the order in they are called:
    mainEDT:
        It does nothing, just starts the code.
        Finally it passes "NULL_GUID" to the beginAlgoEDT.
    beginAlgoEDT
        It creates the "Parabola" data block.
        It calls setupTheParabola(...).
        Finally it passes "Parabola" to the SolveEDT.
    SolveEDT
        It creates the "Roots" data block.
        It calls solveForRoots(in_parabola, o_roots).
        It destroys the "Parabola" data block.
        Finally it passes "Roots" to the CountEDT.
    CountEDT
        It calls deduplicateRoots(io_roots) on the "Roots" data block.
        Finally it passes "Roots" to the PrintEDT.
    PrintEDT
        It calls printRoots(io_roots).
        Finally it passes "Roots" to the PrintEDT.
    endAlgoEDT
        It destroys the "Roots" data block.
        Finally it passes "NULL_GUID" to the finalEDT.
    finalEDT:
        It does nothing, just calls ocrShutdown().

= In autogen,
    = all OCR objects, EDT, data blocks, etc., have to be unique by name.
    = Defaults are assigned as defaults of the underlying objects.
      Please consult the object in question in order to find out what they are.
= The script btest

= The test script "btest" assumes that the command " OCR_TYPE=x86-mpi make run"
  can be successfully run. If so, the black box test "btest" creates a reference file
  "z_ref_output" which is what we expect the code to output.
  It then proceed to autogen the OCR code, run it and compare its output to the reference file.
  Upon success, zero is returned; otherwise whatever caused an error is returned.
