 R-STREAM
------------

R-Stream is advanced compiler technology developed at Reservoir Labs.
Specifically, R-Stream is a source-to-source compiler that accepts a
sequential C program as input and produces code that has been parallelized
and optimized for parallel processors and accelerators. It can output code in
a variety of formats for downstream processors, including highly optimized
OpenMP and CUDA. R-Stream also targets EDT-based environments such as OCR.
R-Stream is under active development and has special new features for low-power
embedded computing and for extreme-scale computing.

Please contact Reservoir Labs using the URL
https://www.reservoir.com/company/contact/ or email x-stack@reservoir.com for
using R-Stream. We will set up accounts so that R-Stream binary can be
downloaded directly from the Reservoir web site.

People downloading R-Stream will have to use the click commercial license for
R-Stream before download, since it is not open source. Additional special
licensing options are available for government and academic organizations.

For user's reference, the examples folder has sample OCR codes automatically
generated by R-Stream for a few benchmarks. In order to compile and run the
examples, please read examples/README.
