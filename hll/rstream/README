Please contact x-stack@reservoir.com for using R-Stream.

We will set up accounts so that R-Stream binary can be downloaded directly from the Reservoir web site.

People downloading will have to use the click commercial license for R-Stream before download, since it is not open source.

For user's reference, the examples folder in the github has sample OCR codes automatically generated by R-Stream for a few benchmarks.
