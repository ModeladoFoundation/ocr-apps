R-Stream + OCR examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains examples of code generated by the R-Stream compiler for
OCR. In the provided examples, the original source codes (suffixed by '.c')
have been automatically parallelized and optimized using R-Stream. The
resulting programs are suffixed by '.ocr.c'.

In order to compile and run the examples, please read examples/README.

R-Stream is a source-to-source compiler that accepts a sequential C program as
input and produces code that has been parallelized and optimized for parallel
processors and accelerators. The provided examples do not need R-Stream to run,
however, if you would like to know more about R-Stream, please contact
