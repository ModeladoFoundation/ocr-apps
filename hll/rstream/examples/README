This directory contains examples of code generated by the R-Stream compiler for
OCR. In the provided examples, the original source codes (suffixed by '.c')
have been automatically parallelized and optimized using R-Stream. The
resulting programs are suffixed by '.gen.c'.

To compile the R-Stream generated OCR files,

1) Please set OCR installation path via the OCR_INSTALL environment variable
  For example: export OCR_INSTALL=/etc/xstack/ocr/install/

   An x86 installation of OCR is expected to be found in $OCR_INSTALL. Please also make sure that
  $OCR_INSTALL/lib is listed in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2) Compile a benchmark:
   ./compile.sh <benchmark-name>
  For example,
  ./compile.sh adi
  ./compile.sh mvt
  ./compile.sh one_d_imperfect_jacobi

3) Setup the OCR configuration you want to use using the OCR_CONFIG environment variable
  For example: export OCR_CONFIG=${PWD}/ocr.cfg

4) Run the binaries.
   For example,
   ./adi
   ./sor

  To check the correctness, pass -c flag:
   ./mvt -c
   ./adi -c
   ./one_d_imperfect_jacobi -c

5) To remove the compiler files, use
   ./clean.sh <benchmark>
   For example,
  ./clean.sh mvt
