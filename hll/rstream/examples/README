This directory contains examples of code generated by the R-Stream compiler for
OCR. In the provided examples, the original source codes (suffixed by '.c')
have been automatically parallelized and optimized using R-Stream. The
resulting programs are suffixed by '.ocr.c'.

To compile the R-Stream generated OCR files,

1) Please set OCR installation path via the OCR_INSTALL environment variable
  For example: export OCR_INSTALL=/etc/ocr/install/x86-pthread-x86
2) Compile a benchmark:
   ./compile.sh <benchmark-name>
  For example,
  ./compile.sh adi
  ./compile.sh mvt
  ./compile.sh one_d_imperfect_jacobi
3) Setup the OCR configuration you want to use using the OCR_CONFIG environment variable
  For example: export OCR_CONFIG=${PWD}/mach-hc-16w.cfg
4) Run the binaries.
   For example,
   ./adi.ocr
   ./sor.ocr

  To check the correctness, pass -c flag:
   ./mvt.ocr -c
   ./adi.ocr -c
   ./one_d_imperfect_jacobi.ocr -c

  The following OCR Warning may be printed with no consequence on the program validity:
API(WARN) [PD:0x0 W:0x31f6ae70 EDT:0x0] Acquiring DB (GUID: 0x31f67bb8) from outside an EDT ... auto-release will fail
  You can safely ignore this warning.

5) To remove generated binaries:
   ./clean.sh <benchmark>
   For example,
  ./clean.sh mvt
