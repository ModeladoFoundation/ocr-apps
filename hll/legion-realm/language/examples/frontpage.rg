struct point { x : float, y : float } -- A simple struct with two fields.

-- Define 4 tasks. Ignore the task bodies for the moment; the behavior of each
-- task is soundly described by its declaration. Note that each declaration
-- says what the task will read or write.
task a(points : region(point)) where writes(points) do --[[ ... ]] end
task b(points : region(point)) where reads writes(points.x) do --[[ ... ]] end
task c(points : region(point)) where reads writes(points.y) do --[[ ... ]] end

-- Execution begins at main. Read the code top-down (like a sequential program).
