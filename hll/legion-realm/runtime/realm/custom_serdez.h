  // When Realm copies data between two instances, it is normally done by bit-wise copies of the data
  //  for each element.  There are two cases where this is either inefficient or incorrect:
  // 1) a complex field type might be compressible (e.g. have a large amount of "don't care" subfields),
  //   reducing the amount of network traffic required to move the instance (although with some increase
  //   in the CPU cost of moving it)
  // 2) a field may actually just hold a pointer to some more dynamic data structure - in this case,
  //   an instance copy needs to be a deep copy of the logical contents of the field

  // custom serdez objects are registered with the runtime at startup (for now) and associated with an ID
  //  that can be provided:
  // a) in CopySrcDstField objects in a copy operation (if one is provided for a field on the source side,
  //   the corresponding dst field also must have a custom serdez - it doesn't technically need to be
  //   the same one, but there's very few cases where having them different makes any sense)
  // b) in the deletion of an instance, allowing any data that was dynamically allocated during
  //   deserialization to be reclaimed

  // for now, a custom serdez is defined in the form of a class that looks like this:
  // (in the not-too-distant future, this will be replaced by a set of CodeDescriptor's)
