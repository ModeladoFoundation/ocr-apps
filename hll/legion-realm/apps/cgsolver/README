To use the program:

- Set the variables in the Makefile based on the debugging and running conditions.

DEBUG=1                       # Include debugging symbols
OUTPUT_LEVEL=LEVEL_WARNING    # Compile time print level(otehr LEVEL_ERROR, LEVEL_DEBUG)
SHARED_LOWLEVEL=0             # Use the shared low level
USE_CUDA=0                    # to activate/deactivate cuda
#ALT_MAPPERS=1                # Compile the alternative mappers

If you use few number of fields in your simulation, you would better set the max. numebr of field to possible
minimum number through CC_FLAG:

CC_FLAGS    := -DMAX_FIELDS=64

- Make the executable file by running "make" command. you can clean the executable file using "make clean".
In order to clean all objects including legion related ones use "make cleanall".

- To run the executable file type:
./cgsolver

or 

./cgsolver -n <nx>(optional)  

where,

nx is the number of INTERNAL grid points in one direction ( either x or y dorection).
for example if we divide the 1-D domain of length 1 to 16 equal pieces, excluding the boundary points there will
be 15 internal points. Note that if nx is not provided, the default values are set to 15.

You can enable predicated execution of by adding the predicate execution flag to CC_FLAGS:

CC_FLAGS += -DPREDICATED_EXECUTION
