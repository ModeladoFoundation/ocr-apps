This is a simple version of kmeans designed for illustrating
some important features of Legion. Is NOT optimized and should
not be considered indicative of the performance that could 
be achieved by a tuned version.

Note that it's possible that this version of kmeans doesn't
converge. The reason is that this implementation relies on
parallel floating point reduction operations, which depending
on the order they are applied can result in different values.
Interestingly, it seems like this effect is observed more
frequently on small numbers of processors (e.g. 2), but is
less noticeable for larger processor counts. This is all 
of course subject to your machine and the particular instance
of the Legion runtime you are using. In practice, we have
only observed non-convergence a few times, so it is likely
that you won't see it at all.
