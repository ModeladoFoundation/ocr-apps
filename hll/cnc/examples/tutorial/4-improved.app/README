This improved version of the application sets up a global graph
context (which stores values like numTiles), and initializes the
context using command-line argument values.

Rather than the initializer prescribing all stencil steps, it only
prescribes those in the first timestep. Each stencil step for a later
timestep is prescribed by the corresponding step for the preceding
timestep. In other words, (stencil i, t) prescribes (stencil i, t+1).

Run the CnC graph translator tool with the provided specification
file to generate a skeleton CnC-OCR project:

cncocr_t Stencil1D.cnc

The included Main.c file parses the command line arguments. Since
these parameters are set in the global graph context, there is no
need to hard-code them in a header file (as done previously).

make run WORKLOAD_ARGS="4 16 4"

The skeleton functions have been fully fleshed-out in the provided
Stencil1D.c and Stencil1D_stencil.c files. The edge cases are also
correctly handled using conditional inputs. The program should now
do some meaningful computation and give the following output:

avg = 0.052438
