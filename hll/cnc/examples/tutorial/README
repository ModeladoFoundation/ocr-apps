This directory contains source code used in the CnC-OCR tutorial from the 4th
Traleika Glacier Applications Workshop (April 6, 2015).

The tutorial is a step-by-step guide for building a simple 1D stencil app
using the CnC-OCR toolchain. The notes corresponding to this code are available
on the CnC-OCR wiki's "Tutorials" section:
