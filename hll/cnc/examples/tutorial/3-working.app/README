Run the CnC graph translator tool with the provided specification
file to generate a skeleton CnC-OCR project:

ucnc_t Stencil1D.cnc

The included Stencil1D_defs.h file defines some values used in the
graph specification (e.g. NUM_TILES) that are necessary for the
project to build correctly. This project should build and run:

make run

The skeleton functions have been fully fleshed-out in the provided
Stencil1D.c and Stencil1D_stencil.c files. The edge cases are also
correctly handled using conditional inputs. The program should now
do some meaningful computation and give the following output:

avg = 0.052438
