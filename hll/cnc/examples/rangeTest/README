Test program for CnC-OCR with ranges
====================================

Follow the instructions in the CnC-OCR README for building and installing the
CnC-OCR runtime and toolchain.

This example includes four source files:

    * rangeTest.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure.
        This application demonstrates using ranges in tag functions.

    * Main.c:
        Entry point for the application. Includes the code to initialize the
        CnC graph, as well as handle the result of the graph computation.

    * StepA.c, StepB.c:
        Step function implementations for the test application.

Run the CnC-OCR graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding code for the
given graph specification, along with the Makefile:

        cncocr_t rangeTest.cnc

Next, compile the application using the generated makefile:

        make

Finally, run the resulting binary:

        ./rangeTest.exec

A successful run should end with the following lines reporting the result:

        Total A [0, 10): 45
        Total B [0, 10): 45
