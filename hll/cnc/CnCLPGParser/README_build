Follow the instructions in the CnCParser folder to get LPG from CVS (@author: Max)

After taking LPG from CVS, create new project in the CnCLPGParser folder.

LPG -> External Tools Configuration.
Set Location t the CnCParser folder. For me it's:
/Users/alina/Rice/CnC-C/trunk/CnCLPGParser/src/CnCParser

Arguments:
-include-directory=${workspace_loc:lpg.generator/templates/java};${workspace_loc:lpg.generator/include/java}; /Users/alina/Rice/CnC-C/trunk/CnCLPGParser/src/CnCParser/cncParser.g

Build LPG => will generate Java files. Will need to edit AbstractAstList to make the add method void and remove the return.

Might need to get the latest lpg jar file from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpg/files/LPG/ and put it in the lib folder.
