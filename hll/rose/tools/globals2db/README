These ROSE tools, globals2db and globals2struct, find all globals,
file statics and function statics in an application.

The tool globals2db:

    1. Creates an OCR Data Block.
    2. Places the globals and statics in the DB.
    3. Initializes the globals and statics which were originally
       initialized in the application.
    4. Updates the references to the globals and statics to
       reflect their new location.
    5. Stores a pointer to the OCR DB in ELS.

The tool globals2struct:

    1. Places the globals and statics in a structure.
    2. Initializes the globals and statics which were originally
       initialized in the application.
    3. Updates the references to the globals and statics to
       reflect their new location.
    4. Stores the pointer to the structure in TLS.


If the Open Community Runtime (OCR) is not installed on your system, see

To build and execute these tools:
    1. Set up the OCR/Xstack environment.

    2. Execute the script to set up the ROSE environment.
         % . ../../rose_env.sh

    3. Build the tools.
         % cd src
         % make

    4. Run the tool using the test case provided.
         % cd ../tests/<tool-name>/<test-name>
         % make



To build the ROSE compiler framework,
    1. Download the ROSE compiler framework from http://rosecompiler.org.

    2. Build the ROSE compiler framework. See http://rosecompiler.org/ROSE_InstallationInstructions.pdf.

    3. Update the script which sets up the ROSE environment to reflect your system.
         % xemacs ../../rose_env.sh &


The ROSE compiler framework, developed at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL), is an open source compiler infrastructure to generate
source-to-source analyzers and translators for multiple source languages
including C, C++, and Fortran.  See http://www.rosecompiler.org/ for
more information.
