This ROSE tool, globals2struct, finds all globals and
file statics in an application, and

    1. Places them in a structure

    2. Initializes the globals and statics which were originally
       initialized in the declaration.

    3. Updates the references to the global and file statics to
       reflect their new location.

The ROSE compiler framework, developed at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL), is an open source compiler infrastructure to generate
source-to-source analyzers and translators for multiple source languages
including C, C++, and Fortran.  See http://www.rosecompiler.org/ for
more information.
