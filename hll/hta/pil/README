This directory contains the source code for PIL and some examples of PIL code.
To run the examples, use the run script provided here. The build script is a
subcomponent of the run script and is not designed to be called on its own.

	> ./run swarm 001
	> ./run afl 002
	> ./run omp 004
	> ./run C 003

The run script generates various source files from the examples. They may be
cleaned up with the clean command.

	> ./clean

(This is master branch.)
