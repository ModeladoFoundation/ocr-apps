Steps:
    - Compile OCR and set OCR_INSTALL to point to the installation of OCR
    - Set and export HTAHLL to this directory
    - Set and export LD_LIBRARY_PATH to $OCR_INSTALL/lib and $HTAHLL/hta/lib
    - Set and export OCR_CONFIG to the configuration you want to use for OCR
      (usually ${OCR_INSTALL}/config/default.cfg)

To test PIL:
    - Go to ${HTAHLL}/pil and run './run ocr 001' (or any of the micro tests)
    - OMP and Reservoir backends are also available

To test HTA:
    - Go to ${HTAHLL}/hta/src and type 'make'
    - Go to ${HTAHLL}/hta/test and type 'make -j32'
    - To run all the microbenchmarks run 'python auto_test.py'. This
      will generate an auto_test_results.txt with the results of all the tests

For the NAS parallel benchmarks:
    - Go to ${HTAHLL}/test/benchmarks/SNU_NPB-1.0.3/NPB3.3-HTA
    - GCC is used. ICC is also possible:
        - in config/make.def replace 'gcc' with 'icc' and '-fopenmp' with '-openmp'
    - To make a benchmark type, for example: 'make EP CLASS=A'. This will build the OMP
      and OCR version
    - Notes:
        - Some benchmarks may require larger heap for OCR (change in the ocr configuration file)
