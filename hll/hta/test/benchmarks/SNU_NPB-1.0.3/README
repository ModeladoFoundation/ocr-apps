This directory contains the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) implementation
using Hierarchical Tiled Array (HTA) library written in Parallel
Intermediate Language (PIL). The implementation is based on Seoul
National University's SNU-NPB with necessary modifications to adapt
HTA programming model.

You can find the original SNU_NPB here:

    NPB3.3-HTA
        The HTA implementation (fork-join PIL) of NPB adapted from SNU-NPB.
    NPB3.3-HTA-SPMD
        The HTA implementation (SPMD PIL) of NPB adapted from SNU-NPB.
    NPB3.3-OMP-C
        A OpenMP C implementation of NPB pulled out from SNU-NPB
        for performance comparison.
    NPB3.3-SER-C

    runtest.py
        An automized test script for fork-join mode benchmarks.
    runtest-spmd.py
        An automized test script for SPMD mode benchmarks.
    runserial.py
        An automized test script to generate sequential execution time.
===============================================================================
    Setup the environment
===============================================================================

    1. Make sure your PIL and HTA libraries are correctly installed.
       PATH should also include paths to OCR and SWARM.
    2. Check NPB3.3-HTA/config/make.def and make sure the configurations
       are correct. Especially the CC and CFLAGS settings.
    3. Under NPB3.3-HTA/, try to make EP benchmark.
            make EP CLASS=A
    4. The executable will be in NPB3.3-HTA/bin
            OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 bin/ep.A.x.omp
